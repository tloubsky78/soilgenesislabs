## PART 2: MATERIAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Primary Recommendation: PLA (Polylactic Acid)

**Why PLA:**
- ✅ Biodegradable in soil (2-3 year timeline matches project goal)
- ✅ Cost-effective ($20-25/kg)
- ✅ Excellent printability on belt printer
- ✅ Strong enough for installation and 1-2 year field service
- ✅ Derived from renewable resources (corn starch)
- ✅ No toxic leaching into soil

**Specific Material Requests:**

1. **Standard PLA** (baseline option)
   - Natural/white color preferred (easier to see Universal Blend coating coverage)
   - Minimal additives

2. **Wood-filled PLA** (premium option - if available)
   - 30-40% wood fiber content
   - Faster biodegradation
   - Better soil integration
   - Natural aesthetic
   - **Note:** May require larger nozzle (0.6mm+)

3. **Hemp PLA** (thematically aligned - if available)
   - Hemp fiber reinforcement
   - Aligns with hemp oil binder used in composite version

### Alternative: PA12 Nylon (SLS Process)

**If you recommend SLS for superior quality:**
- Excellent mechanical properties
- No support material needed (powder bed supports)
- Smooth surface finish
- Higher cost but professional-grade result
- **Question for your team:** Is PA12 biodegradable or should we stick with PLA?

## PART 3: PRINTING SPECIFICATIONS

### Recommended Process: Belt Printing (Continuous 12" Length)

**Your belt printer is PERFECT for this application!**

**Print Orientation:**
- **Lengthwise along belt** - prints entire 12" in one piece
- No assembly required
- No layer delamination risk
- Continuous spiral cavity throughout

**Print Settings (Recommendations - Defer to Your Expertise):**

| Parameter | Suggested Value | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Layer Height** | 0.2-0.3mm | Balance quality/speed |
| **Wall Line Count** | 3-4 lines | 1.2-1.6mm total wall thickness |
| **Infill Percentage** | 10-15% | Lightweight, structural support |
| **Infill Pattern** | Gyroid or Cubic | Good strength-to-weight |
| **Top/Bottom Layers** | 4-5 layers | Seal hollow cavity |
| **Print Speed** | 50-70mm/s | Balance quality/time |
| **Support Material** | Minimal/None | Design should be self-supporting |

**Estimated Print Time per Unit:** 8-12 hours (your expertise will refine this)

### Alternative: FDM Printing in Sections

**If belt printer is unavailable or cost-prohibitive:**

- Print in **two 6" sections** with threaded connection
- Thread specification: M30 x 1.5mm pitch (common, strong)
- Orientation: Vertical on standard FDM bed
- Assembly: User screws sections together before installation

## PART 5: POST-PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS

### Surface Preparation (Done by Me After Delivery)

**Universal Blend Coating Application:**

After receiving printed columns from you, I will:

1. **Surface prep:** Light sanding (220 grit) on exterior only
2. **Primer coat:** Spray/dip in humic acid + water solution
3. **Universal Blend application:** Spray coating of proprietary amendment blend

## PART 10: SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT (For Your Interest)

### Why This Matters:

This is a research-backed soil restoration technology validated by peer-reviewed science:

**Robinson et al. 2024** demonstrated that 8 kHz acoustic stimulation at 80 dB:
- Increased Trichoderma spore activity by ~500%
- Increased fungal biomass by 170%
- Works through mechanotransduction (mechanical → electrical signal conversion)

**Our innovation:** Instead of actively generating frequencies (requires power, electronics), the Genesis Column **passively amplifies** the natural electromagnetic/acoustic signals fungi already emit (0.5-10,000 Hz range) through mechanotransduction.

**The hollow spiral cavity** acts as an acoustic waveguide similar to how:
- Acoustic guitars amplify string vibrations
- Seashells amplify ocean sounds
- Wind instruments create resonance

**This is the first biodegradable, passive acoustic soil restoration device in existence.**

Your 3D printing expertise is helping bring regenerative agriculture technology to life!
